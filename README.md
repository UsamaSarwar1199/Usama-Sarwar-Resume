Let's Begin


Step 1:

Write the Website code. Here we are writing it ourself but getting a free template so that we can modify it.

Step2: Extract the Code and Add the Code on the S3 Bucket 

Here we will Create a S3 Bucket by the name usamasarwar1.

Here we selected the files to upload on the bucket

Here we will enable the Static Hosting of the Site .

Step3: As We have an Unverified AWS Account so We can use Github Pages to Deploy our Site


Now as we don't have complete access to the AWS Account so we can use Github Pages to Deploy our site








So go to  the Settings

Then go to pages and enable the github pages

We can also add our custom domain here

As I already have this domain i can use it but for now we can go with the default setting.
